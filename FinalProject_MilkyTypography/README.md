## Project Description
[Credits: Sel√ßuk Artut]
"Noise is usually described as unwanted. However, in creative coding, instead of randomness, we use certain types of noise to generate 
all kinds of organic effects like clouds, landscapes, and contours. It is a belief that runs counter to reality to think that randomness 
can exist in a deterministic system like a computer or other computing device. Knowing this, computers can only work with a limited seed 
corpus to generate an infinite set of numbers that give the appearance of being random. In comparison, the relational order in the sequence 
of numbers with a certain freedom of distance and variety gives us the feeling of more organic and harmonious patterns. In this exhibition, 
we try to explore the world of dynamism that can be created in the peripherals of order and chaos, specifically focusing on the concept 
of noise."

"Milky Typography" is a unique and playful typeface that explores the intersection of typography and fluid dynamics. The project
features a new typeface, "MilkyType," that is inspired by the movement and patterns of milk as it splashes and flows. This typeface
can be used in headlines, titles, and short phrases and it is perfect for creating eye-catching designs in advertising, packaging, ,
and branding. "Milky Typography" is an exciting and innovative project that pushes the boundaries of typography and design.
